    <h1>About Classroom of the Elite</h1>
    <h2>What is the Classroom of the Elite Program?</h2>
    <p>The Classroom of the Elite (COTE) Program is an innovation designed to improve student engagement, academic performance, and holistic growth through a merit and demerit system. More than just a grading tool, it is a culture-building initiative that emphasizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leadership and Discipline</strong> – guiding students to become responsible and self-driven.</li>
      <li><strong>Teamwork and Peer Support</strong> – promoting the idea that no one should be left behind.</li>
      <li><strong>Resilience and Responsibility</strong> – encouraging students to learn from mistakes and persevere.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency and Growth</strong> – providing a clear system where students can track their points, progress, and achievements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By blending creative activities, modern technology, and peer-to-peer collaboration, the program ensures that learning is meaningful, interactive, and future-ready. Students not only improve academically but also develop the character, values, and life skills needed to thrive beyond the classroom.</p>
    <h2>Classroom of the Elite under Project E.L.I.T.E.</h2>
    <p>The COTE Program is implemented under Project E.L.I.T.E., a school-wide initiative that aims to raise the academic performance of STEM students and strengthen their overall readiness for higher learning and real-world challenges.</p>
    <h3>E.L.I.T.E. stands for:</h3>
    <p><strong>Enhancing Learner Intelligence and Training for Excellence</strong></p>
    <p>This meaning reflects the project’s commitment to equipping students with solid academic foundations, leadership skills, integrity, teamwork, and resilience—qualities that make them not only achievers in school, but leaders in life.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The Classroom of the Elite Program is not just about points or competitions. It is about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building a culture where students support each other’s growth.</li>
      <li>Developing future-ready individuals who value discipline, teamwork, honesty, and perseverance.</li>
      <li>Inspiring students to become responsible and compassionate leaders who carry their learning beyond the classroom.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>✨ In essence, the Classroom of the Elite Program transforms the classroom into a training ground for excellence in academics, values, and life.</p>
